# Machine-Learning-Project
-> It is a project which used to find the accuracy and the prediction values of a dataset using Machine Learning algorithms.
-> From this you colud be able to predict the accuray of a preprocessed dataset and you could be able to select the algorithms and can get the accuracy.


**Algorithms used:**

Regression Algorithms:
  -> Simple Linear Regression.
  -> Multi-linear Regression.
  -> Polynomial Regression.
  -> SVM Regression.
  -> Decisiontree Regression.
  -> RandomForest Regression.

Classification Algorithms:
  -> Naive Bayes Classifier.
  -> Logistic Regression.
  -> KNN Classifier.
  -> SVM Classifier.
  -> DecisionTree Classifier.
  -> RandomForest Classifier.
  
 Clustering Algorithms:
  -> Hierarchical Clustering.
  -> KMeans Clustering.
  
**Uses:**
  -> The main use of this algorithm is you could be able to find best algorithm, which gives more accuracy for your model.
